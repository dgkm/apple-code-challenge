# Performance Test for Frontend and Backend Integration

## Objective

The goal of this test is to load and display a list of network assets in a performant and efficient manner. Each asset should be displayed in its own component, showcasing all fields in a manner that is both aesthetically pleasing and easy to navigate. A **search functionality** should be implemented to filter the results based on the "host" column.

Candidates are encouraged to improve both the **Go backend** and the **Next.js frontend** to achieve optimal performance and usability. **Efficiency and speed** are key, and we expect you to identify, fix, and document any performance bottlenecks you find.

### Requirements

1. **Performance Optimization**:

   - The app should handle large datasets efficiently. The backend must be optimized for fast API responses, and the frontend should render the data without unnecessary delays.

2. **Signature Calculation**:

   - The signature generation functionality **must be preserved**. Each asset, along with its associated ports and IPs, must have a signature calculated and included in the response.

3. **Aesthetic Frontend**:

   - The frontend must be user-friendly and visually appealing. Candidates should focus on presenting the data in a clear and structured way that enhances the user experience.

4. **Search Functionality**:

   - A search feature should be implemented in the frontend to filter the assets by the **"host"** column. The search should be efficient, responsive, and provide relevant results quickly.

5. **Problem Identification and Documentation**:
   - Candidates should **identify all performance problems** (both in the frontend and backend), **fix them**, and **document the changes**. A list of identified inefficiencies and their solutions must be provided.

## Notes

We strive for excellence in everything we do, and we are looking for top-tier talent to join our team. Code quality, efficiency, and adherence to best practices will be assessed.

## Backend Setup

1. **Generate the Database**  
   In the `Backend` folder:

   Run the following command to create and populate the SQLite database with 250,000 assets:

   ```bash
   make load-db
   ```

2. **Start the API Server**  
   Run the following command to start the Go API server:

   ```bash
   make start-dev
   ```

   The API server will be running at `http://localhost:8080`.

## Frontend Setup

1. **Install Dependencies**  
   Navigate to the frontend directory and install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

2. **Start the Next.js Application**  
   Run the following command to start the frontend application:

   ```bash
   pnpm run dev
   ```

   The frontend will be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

## API Endpoints

- **Get all assets or filter by host**:  
  This endpoint returns all assets :

  ```http
  GET http://localhost:8080/assets
  ```

### Key Points for Candidates

- Focus on improving **speed** and **efficiency** in both the backend API and the frontend rendering.
- Ensure that the **signature calculation** for each asset, port, and IP remains intact and is efficient.
- The **frontend design** should be visually appealing and ensure a smooth user experience.
- Implement a **search functionality** that allows filtering by the "host" column.
- Document all **identified performance problems**, your **solutions**, and any **changes** made to improve the application's performance.

This version clearly specifies the focus areas, including performance improvement, signature functionality, and search implementation, while emphasizing the need for documentation of the problems identified and fixed. Let me know if this works or if you need any further adjustments!# CodeInterview
